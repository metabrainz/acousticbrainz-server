Astroid
=======

What's this?
------------

The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
governed by pylint's needs. It used to be called logilab-astng.

It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`
module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
usages.  They include some support for static inference and local name
scopes.  Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living
objects.

Main modules are:

* `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
  different type of nodes of the tree.

* the `manager` contains a high level object to get astroid trees from
  source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
  constructed tree for quick access.


Installation
------------

Extract the tarball, jump into the created directory and run::

	python setup.py install

For installation options, see::

	python setup.py install --help

Python Versions
---------------

astroid is compatible with Python 2.7 as well as 3.3 and later. astroid uses
the same code base for both Python versions, using six.

Test
----

Tests are in the 'test' subdirectory. To launch the whole tests suite
at once, you can use unittest discover::

  python -m unittest discover -p "unittest*.py"
