  <h2 class="page-title">Contributing to AcousticBrainz</h2>

  <p>
    In order to contribute acoustic data to AcousticBrainz, you will need to have a music collection
    that contains MusicBrainz IDs. This usually means that your collection will need to have been
    tagged with a MusicBrainz aware tagger like <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">Picard</a>
    or other <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Products">MusicBrainz enabled taggers</a>. If you
    have a collection of lossless FLAC files that would be ideal, but having lossy also helps the
    project. Our tools support the following file extensions: mp3 ogg oga flac mp4 m4a m4r m4b m4p
    aac wma asf mpc wv spx tta 3g2 aif aiff ape

    If you're an open source geek and would like to tinker with the source code to AcousticBrainz,
    take a look at the following list of repositories that make up the project:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/MTG/essentia">essentia</a>: The audio analysis engine that underpins AcousticBrainz.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/acousticbrainz-server">acousticbrainz-server</a>: The server that runs the web site and manages the JSON document collection.</li>
    </ul>
