  <h2 class="page-title">Contributing to AcousticBrainz</h2>

  <p>
    In order to contribute acoustic data to AcousticBrainz, you will need to have a music collection
    that contains MusicBrainz IDs. This usually means that your collection will need to have been
    tagged with a MusicBrainz aware tagger like <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org/">Picard</a>
    or other <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Products">MusicBrainz enabled taggers</a>. If you
    have a collection of lossless FLAC files that would be ideal, but having lossy also helps the
    project. Our tools support the following file extensions: mp3 ogg oga flac mp4 m4a m4r m4b m4p
    aac wma asf mpc wv spx tta 3g2 aif aiff ape
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have a collection of music files with MBIDs, please use
    <a href="{{ url_for('index.downloads') }}">one of the submission tools</a> to help us bootstrap
    this project. We have GUI based tools for Linux, Mac and Windows, so it is easy for anyone with
    an MBID tagged collection to contribute.
